# Share Certificate AI (local_socialcert)

A Moodle plugin that adds an **“Add certificate to LinkedIn”** button to **Custom certificate** activities and, optionally, generates a **professional AI message** ready for your LinkedIn post. All with **one click** for the learner.

> **Dependency:** Requires [`mod_customcert`](https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_customcert). It doesn’t modify *Custom certificate*; it only adds a contextual action.

---

## Features

* **LinkedIn Add-to-profile** button on each issued certificate (from *Custom certificate*).
* **Provider AI** integration (another Buen Data plugin) to **suggest LinkedIn post copy**.
* Public verification link (`verify.php?code=...`) included automatically.
* Complies with Moodle’s privacy API; **no additional personal data** is stored.
* Languages: English (default), Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Indonesian, and Russian.

## Plugin Configuration

Once installed, configure the plugin as follows:

1. **Sign in as a site administrator.**
2. Navigate to **Site administration → Plugins → Local plugins → Share Certificate AI**.
3. In **General settings**, review and complete:

   * **Organization name** (`organizationname`) — *recommended*.

     * Used in the suggested LinkedIn text and as the certificate issuer name.
     * For best results, enter the **exact name as it appears on LinkedIn** (same casing, spacing, and accents).
   * **LinkedIn Organization ID** (`organizationid`) — *optional*.

     * Use only if you post on behalf of a **LinkedIn Company Page**.
     * If left empty, LinkedIn’s **default behavior** applies (user profile or default context).
   * **Enable AI** (`enableai`) — *global toggle*.

     * Turn on to show the **Generate text for LinkedIn** button on the certificate page. If off, the panel won’t offer the suggested text.
4. Click **Save changes**.
5. *(Recommended)* Go to **Site administration → Development → Purge all caches** to ensure the frontend reflects the new settings.

### How to find your LinkedIn Organization ID

You must be an **administrator** of your institution’s LinkedIn Page.

1. Open your organization’s LinkedIn Page in admin view.
2. Copy the **numeric ID** from the URL.

Example:

```
https://www.linkedin.com/company/61803398/admin/...
```

In this example, the **Organization ID** is `61803398`.

### Organization name recommendations

* Use the **exact public name** of the LinkedIn Page (match capitalization, accents, and spaces).
* This helps ensure consistent behavior across the plugin.

## Using it in a course

1. **Add a Custom certificate** activity to your course.
2. Make sure the learner **already has an issued certificate** (entry exists in `customcert_issues`).
3. The **Add to LinkedIn profile** action will appear in the activity menu **only when**:

   * An **issue** exists for the current user, **and**
   * A valid **`organizationid`** is configured in the plugin settings.

> **Important**
>
> * If **no certificate has been issued**, the action is blocked and an **error is shown**.
> * In that case, the plugin **will not take the user to LinkedIn** and the share flow is not available until the certificate is issued.
